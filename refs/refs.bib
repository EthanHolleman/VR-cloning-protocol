              RNA-mediated chromatin silencing is central to genome regulation in many organisms. However, how nascent non-coding transcripts regulate chromatin is poorly understood. Here, through analysis of Arabidopsis
              FLC
              , we show that resolution of a nascent-transcript-induced R-loop promotes chromatin silencing. Stabilization of an antisense-induced R-loop at the 3′ end of
              FLC
              enables an RNA binding protein FCA, with its direct partner FY/WDR33 and other 3′-end processing factors, to polyadenylate the nascent antisense transcript. This clears the R-loop and recruits the chromatin modifiers demethylating H3K4me1. FCA immunoprecipitates with components of the m

              chromatin silencing. This mechanism also targets other loci in the Arabidopsis genome, and consistent with this

If the target sequences are prone to folding into noncanonical secondary structures, such as G-quadruplex (GQ), the conformational states and activity of the CRISPR–Cas9 complex may be influenced, but the impact has not been assessed. Using single molecule FRET, we investigated structural characteristics of the complex formed by CRISPR–Cas9 and target DNA, which contains a potentially GQ forming sequence (PQS) in either the target or the nontarget strand (TS or NTS). We observed different conformational states and dynamics depending on the stability of the GQ and the position of PQS. When PQS was in NTS, we observed evidence for GQ formation for both weak and stable GQs. This is consistent with R-loop formation between TS and crRNA releasing NTS from Watson–Crick pairing and facilitating secondary structure formation in it. When PQS was in TS, R-loop formation was adequate to maintain a weak GQ in the unfolded state but not a GQ with moderate or high stability. The observed structural heterogeneity within the target dsDNA and the R-loop strongly depended on whether the PQS was in TS or NTS. We propose these variations in the complex structures to have functional implications for Cas9 activity.},

	abstract = {Defects in DNA repair frequently lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the particular importance of DNA repair in long-lived post-mitotic neurons1,2. The cellular genome is subjected to a constant barrage of endogenous DNA damage, but surprisingly little is known about the identity of the lesion(s) that accumulate in neurons and whether they accrue throughout the genome or at specific loci. Here we show that post-mitotic neurons accumulate unexpectedly high levels of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) at specific sites within the genome. Genome-wide mapping reveals that SSBs are located within enhancers at or near CpG dinucleotides and sites of DNA demethylation. These SSBs are repaired by PARP1 and XRCC1-dependent mechanisms. Notably, deficiencies in XRCC1-dependent short-patch repair increase DNA repair synthesis at neuronal enhancers, whereas defects in long-patch repair reduce synthesis. The high levels of SSB repair in neuronal enhancers are therefore likely to be sustained by both short-patch and long-patch processes. These data provide the first evidence of site- and cell type-specific SSB repair, revealing unexpected levels of localized and continuous DNA breakage in neurons. In addition, they suggest an explanation for the neurodegenerative phenotypes that occur in patients with defective SSB repair.},

Recently, evidence has emerged that R loops occur more often in the genome and have greater physiological relevance, including roles in transcription and chromatin structure, than was previously predicted. Importantly, however, R loops are also a major threat to genome stability. For this reason, several DNA and RNA metabolism factors prevent R‑loop formation in cells. Dysfunction of these factors causes R‑loop accumulation, which leads to replication stress, genome instability, chromatin alterations or gene silencing, phenomena that are frequently associated with cancer and a number of genetic diseases. We review the current knowledge of the mechanisms controlling R loops and their putative relationship with disease.},

	abstract = {Single-strand breaks (SSBs) represent the major form of DNA damage, yet techniques to map these lesions genome-wide with nucleotide-level precision are limited. Here, we present a method, termed SSiNGLe, and demonstrate its utility to explore the distribution and dynamic changes in genome-wide SSBs in response to different biological and environmental stimuli. We validate SSiNGLe using two very distinct sequencing techniques and apply it to derive global profiles of SSBs in different biological states. Strikingly, we show that patterns of SSBs in the genome are non-random, specific to different biological states, enriched in regulatory elements, exons, introns, specific types of repeats and exhibit differential preference for the template strand between exons and introns. Furthermore, we show that breaks likely contribute to naturally occurring sequence variants. Finally, we demonstrate strong links between SSB patterns and age. Overall, SSiNGLe provides access to unexplored realms of cellular biology, not obtainable with current approaches.},
